        <h1>About</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">Turkish WebVectors is a tool to compute semantic relations between words in Turkish on the web, 
                making it easy to demonstrate their abilities to general public. 
                It is based on the toolkit <a href="https://github.com/akutuzov/webvectors">WebVectors</a> 
                Semantic vectors reflect meaning based on word co-occurrence 
                <strong>distribution</strong> in the training corpus (huge amounts of raw linguistic data).</p>
